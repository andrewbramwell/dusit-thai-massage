        "title": "The Journey Behind Dusit Thai Massage",
        "p-1": "Lamai's connection to Thai massage began long before it became her profession. Growing up in Buriram, Thailand, she learned the ancient healing art directly from her mother—not in a classroom, but through years of hands-on practice and observation. This authentic knowledge, passed down through genuine experience, gave her an intuitive understanding of the body's pressure points, energy lines, and the therapeutic power of skilled touch that no certificate alone could provide.",
        "p-2": "After moving to Germany 30 years ago, life took Lamai on different paths, but the knowledge and passion for Thai massage remained with her. In 2020, she returned to her true calling, joining a professional massage studio in Berlin where she spent several years treating clients with diverse needs—from chronic pain and sports injuries to stress relief and wellness maintenance. In early 2025, she opened Dusit Thai Massage with a clear vision: to create a trusted space where clients could experience genuine healing, lasting pain relief, and the personalized attention that makes a real difference.",
        "p-3": "Today, clients consistently praise Lamai's ability to identify and release tension that others overlook. Her combination of authentic Thai techniques with decades of hands-on experience allows her to provide treatments that go beyond surface relaxation. Whether you're dealing with chronic back pain, recovering from physical strain, or simply need to escape daily stress, Lamai brings genuine expertise and attentive care to every session at Dusit Thai Massage.",
        "p-4": "My goal is simple—to help every client feel real relief and leave feeling better than when they arrived. This is not just my work, it's my passion.",
