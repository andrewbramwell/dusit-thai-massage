It combines traditional Thai massage, acupuncture, shiatsu, Tui Na, and physiology into a holistic treatment performed without oils or aids. Through acupressure using thumbs, palms, and knees, meridians and trigger points are activated to release energy blockages and alleviate ailments such as pain and migraines. The massage works on tendons, muscles, fascia, nerves, joints, and the skeletal system – while the practitioner cultivates a meditative Mettā state."
